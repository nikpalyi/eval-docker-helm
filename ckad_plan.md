## 1-month CKAD certification learning plan

## Week 1: Understanding CKAD Exam and Core Concepts

### Day 1-2: 
Research the CKAD certification, its format, and requirements. Familiarize yourself with the official Kubernetes documentation.
###  Day 3-4: 
Review core Kubernetes concepts: Pods, Services, Deployments, ConfigMaps, Secrets, and Persistent Volumes.
### Day 5-7: 
Practice creating and managing basic resources. Use the kubectl command-line tool for basic operations.

Practice creating and managing ReplicationControllers and Pods.
Use kubectl get rc and kubectl scale rc <rc-name> --replicas=<desired-replicas>

## Week 2: Application Lifecycle Management

### Day 8-9: 
Learn about ReplicaSets and Deployments. Understand rolling updates and rollbacks.

Create a Deployment using kubectl create deployment.
Scale the Deployment using kubectl scale deployment <deployment-name> --replicas=<desired-replicas>.

### Day 10-12:
Explore Labels, Selectors, and Annotations. Understand how to use these effectively in resource definitions.

Create a Job to run a batch process and ensure it completes.
Use kubectl create cronjob to create a CronJob for scheduled tasks.

### Day 13-14: 
Study Jobs and CronJobs for batch processing and scheduled tasks.

Update a Deployment's image version using kubectl set image.
Perform a rolling update and a rollback using kubectl rollout.

## Week 3: Services and Networking

### Day 15-17: 

Dive into Services: ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. Understand how to expose applications internally and externally.

Create a Service of type ClusterIP to expose an app within the cluster.
Create a Service of type NodePort to expose an app externally.
Experiment with different service types and kubectl port-forward for local access.

### Day 18-20: 

Learn about Network Policies to control pod communication within the cluster.

Create Network Policies to control traffic between pods.
Test the Network Policies to ensure they are enforced.

### Day 21: 

Review all networking concepts and practice creating various networking configurations.

Recap all networking concepts.
Create a comprehensive example involving Services, Ingress, and Network Policies.

## Week 4: Configurations and Observability

### Day 22-24: 

Study ConfigMaps and Secrets for configuration management. Understand how to inject them into pods.

Create a ConfigMap and a Secret, then consume them in a Pod.
Update the ConfigMap and Secret and observe the changes in the Pod.

### Day 25-26: 
Explore Resource Limits and Quality of Service (QoS).

Set resource limits and requests in a Pod's definition.
Use the kubectl top command to monitor resource utilization.

### Day 27-28: 
Learn about Pod Design and how to work with Multi-Container Pods.

Create a multi-container Pod and ensure inter-container communication.
Set up liveness and readiness probes for a Pod.

### Day 29-30: 
Familiarize yourself with liveness and readiness probes, and practice logging and debugging techniques.

Create a Pod that generates logs, then access and analyze the logs.
Simulate a container failure and debug using logs and probes.

## Recommended Study Materials:

### Online Courses:
Kubernetes Basics (official Kubernetes documentation)
CKAD Certification Preparation Courses (Udemy, Linux Academy, etc.)

### Books:
"Kubernetes in Action" by Marko Luksa
Practice Platforms:
Katacoda
Kubernetes Playground (for hands-on practice)
CKAD Exercises (GitHub repository with practical exercises)

### Hands-on Labs and Practice:
Use the Kubernetes Playground and CKAD Exercises repository for hands-on practice.
Create a personal Kubernetes cluster using tools like Minikube or k3s for practicing without risking production systems.

### Milestones and Checkpoints:
- End of Week 1: Successfully create and manage basic resources using kubectl.
- End of Week 2: Understand and implement application lifecycle management concepts.
- End of Week 3: Confidently configure services and understand networking concepts.
- End of Week 4: Competently handle configurations, observability, and debugging.

## Adjustment Strategy:
Regularly take practice tests and use mock exams to assess your readiness. If you're not meeting your milestones, allocate more time to areas where you're struggling. Focus on hands-on practice and solving real-world scenarios.
